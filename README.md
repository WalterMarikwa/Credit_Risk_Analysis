# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The goal of this study is to determine which model performs best on such an unbalanced dataset by applying machine learning to assess credit card risk using a file of loan applications and their statuses. 

## Resources

- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3, Imbalanced-Learn Library, SciKit-Learn Library.

## Summary
All examined models demonstrated limited precision in identifying high credit risk, with none displaying a precision score higher than 10%. The recall score for high credit risk is improved by the EasyEnsembleClassifier to 91 percent. The EasyEnsembleClassifier's precision of 7% demonstrates that the algorithm continues to classify many low credit risks as high.
